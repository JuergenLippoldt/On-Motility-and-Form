These are MatLab scripts and functions used to analyse tracks from FijI/TrackMate and segemtations of confocal data for the publication 'Cell-cell adhesion and 3D matrix confinement determine jamming transitions in breast cancer invasion'.

The code is not written to be universially usefull. It is mainly posted here to make the data analysis of the manuscript above more transperent. It is adabted to the problem at hand and I suspect that it will not work well on your problem without modification.

The files starting with 'run_' are scripts. The other files are helping functions used in the scripts. There might be files from MatLab File Exchange in use (https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/). 

Feel free to use the code as starting point or inspiration, if you are working on a similar problem. Feel free to to ask for an explaination, if the admittatly minimal comments are not clear enough.
